# Project Title
# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-and-Prediction-of-US-Accidents

## About the Project

This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and prediction of accident severity using the US Car Accidents dataset. The dataset covers accident data from 49 states in the USA, collected from February 2016 to March 2023. We have performed a comprehensive analysis of the dataset, extracted valuable insights, and developed a machine learning model to predict accident severity.

## Dataset Description

### Description

This dataset is a countrywide collection of car accident data, collected in real-time from various sources, including traffic cameras, traffic sensors, law enforcement agencies, and more. It contains approximately 7.7 million accident records and covers a wide range of information related to each accident.

## Inspiration

The US-Accidents dataset can be used for various applications, including real-time car accident prediction, studying accident hotspots, casualty analysis, and more. The dataset is also valuable for understanding the impact of environmental factors, such as precipitation or COVID-19, on accident occurrence.
